### Team Reflection
This milestone working on the Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) a few issues we ran into initially were making sure to keep the diagram simple, reducing noise of the diagram for better readability for the user and preventing distractions. Our team working on designs wants to keep a thorough understanding of the system but can run into the problem of sometimes over complicating by adding additional external interactions with how the system works not in just the system only environment. Our initial diagrams were trying to incorporate Security Information and Event Manager (SIEM) to show further explanation of possible vulnerabilities, but this ended up being out of the scope of the system specific functionality (back to reducing noise). Another area was expecting there to be a generic data flow for both to and from which was not always the case and we found out could actually end up needing a separate process for if that was always the case. The best way we were able to attack the issues above was by simplifying but not distorting the topics. There were no additional external interactors that needed to be included in the system view if they were not directly related to the system itself. Our group was able to create a few different DFDs and continued to refine to be able to get a more concise deliverable, which after iterations made it clear of troubles we were running into at each step. The plan moving forward is to continue to focus on the system itself without having external interactors such as SIEM distort our view of the system or entice us to add more information than necessary that could distract the customer from what we should be presenting as the final product of the DFD.
