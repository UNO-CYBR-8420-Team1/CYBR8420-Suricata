- An important thing to note is some of the CWEs listed below are either parents are children to each other. If we decide to examine for some of these CWEs we will want to select which ones fit best.
- These are some possible options to consider to help with constructing our code review strategy. Some of these may not be necessarily applicable to what we need.
