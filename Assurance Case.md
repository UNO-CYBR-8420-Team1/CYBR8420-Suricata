## Part 1
### Assurance Case 1
#### Top-Level Claim: Suricata protects the network from DoS attacks
![Diagram](https://github.com/UNO-CYBR-8420-Team1/CYBR8420-Suricata/blob/main/Assurance%20Cases/Assurance%20Case1.drawio%20(1).png)
#### Argument
This assurance case focuses on Suricata protecting the network from DoS or Denial of Service attacks. The idea that a denial of service attack can affect the way the system runs can impact the network systems, services, and accountability of care given to the customers of the hospital.

The system is set up for efficient packet capture through system load, load balancing and capture filters. Some evidence we have to reinforce whether the system is set up to work efficiently or needs additional adjustment is [performance analysis](https://docs.suricata.io/en/latest/performance/analysis.html) in which we can see the system load to get an idea of the traffic breakdown. The user can run the “htop” command to see the results. Additionally within the performance analysis we can check stats.log or suricata.log files for a deeper dive into this analysis. Next, the user will need to run load balancing to run multithreading to offset load of network traffic to the system which allows it to take on more data and analyze through it more efficiently. The breakup of the network traffic allows it to properly sort this traffic to prevent overload and system degradation/failure. The security analyst can also set up [capture filters](https://docs.suricata.io/en/latest/performance/ignoring-traffic.html) to allow the system to ignore specific traffic to focus on what the analyst actually wants to see, preventing alert and log fatigue allowing only the important data to stream through and be logged.

Next part of the rebuttal of Suricata software is not set up properly is that Suricata rules are created to mitigate traffic. The customer and security analyst are able to tell if rules are set up properly or created based off the result from the alerts detection log. If the system doesn’t log anything we can draw an inference that there are no rules created or they were not properly set up since the system will never be perfect for there is always traffic running in the hospital environment that is very busy. Rules can be specified by the security analyst in set up and are found with more data in section [11.11.5 Rules](https://docs.suricata.io/en/latest/performance/analysis.html#rules).

Although not specifically stated in the Suricata documentation hardware limitations exist in any system and can affect the way a system performs. Suricata mentions that with certain hardware [requirements](https://docs.suricata.io/en/latest/capture-hardware/ebpf-xdp.html#requirements) such as a system that can run kernel XDP and a network card that supports XDP. The expansion of business or end of life (EOL) hardware can cause future troubles or limitations to the efficiency of the system and how it performs. If the system only has 10GB of memory, logs could fill leading to system failure before the logs could be stored and reviewed in a larger hospital network. The claim for business growing exponentially is that Suricata is retrofitted with future expansion to prevent this from happening which can be provided by a business needs report from hospital tech management. The claim that hardware is end of life is that obsolete hardware is replaced proactively. The evidence from this is a manufacturer’s end of life report that allows the business to know what needs replaced before it is no longer supported to stay on top.

Last rebuttal part of this assurance case for Suricata protecting the network from DoS is that Suricata is not up to date. A system that is not up to date especially handling the needs of Personally Identifiable Information or (PII) can be exposed to malicious actors. The security analyst will regularly stay up to date with Suricata [releases](https://suricata.io/category/release/) which are managed and verified from Suricata’s direct website.
### Assurance Case 2
#### Top-Level Claim: Suricata detects unauthorized network traffic
![Diagram](https://github.com/UNO-CYBR-8420-Team1/CYBR8420-Suricata/blob/main/Assurance%20Cases/mpopelka_Suricata%20Assurance%20Case.drawio%20(2).png)
#### Argument
This assurance case focuses one of Suricata’s primary features: detecting unauthorized network traffic. As Suricata is an Intrusion Detection and Prevention System, being able to identify unauthorized network traffic is crucial.

At a basic level, Suricata must be installed to function. Since Suricata is an open-source software, its installation is fairly simple: download the software package and install it. After Suricata is installed, the Suricata administrator must enable the network monitoring feature. Otherwise, Suricata will not monitor network traffic. Proper functionality can be verified by reviewing Suricata logs to ensure traffic is being monitored.

When configuring Suricata to monitor for unauthorized network traffic, it is important to enable the proper Suricata modes. If Suricata is configured in host protection mode, it will only monitor traffic coming from and leaving the host it is on. As outlined in Suricata’s documentation for configuring [inline mode](https://docs.suricata.io/en/latest/setting-up-ipsinline-for-linux.html), configuring Suricata in inline mode will allow the Intrusion Detection portion of Suricata to alert on unauthorized traffic. Once Suricata is configured to monitor inline traffic, the administrator will need to define specific rules that can detect unauthorized traffic. Alerts from Suricata can be used to determine if network traffic rules are properly defined.

To detect unauthorized network traffic, proper detection rules must be implemented and configured into Suricata.  Once the rules are configured, alerting must be enabled for Suricata to generate alerts when rule parameters are met. This can be verified by viewing the alerts Suricata generates. It is important to regularly update the unauthorized network traffic rule parameters, because if the unauthorized traffic does not match the existing rules, alerts will not be generated. Additionally, unauthorized network traffic can be disguised as normal traffic. Ensuring the rules are regularly updated to look for new types of unauthorized traffic will ensure Suricata generates alerts for all unauthorized traffic. This can be verified by reviewing network traffic logs from Suricata.

For Suricata to detect unauthorized traffic, it must be configured on a production network. If multiple production networks exist within an entity, Suricata must be configured to monitor uplink and downlink traffic of all production networks to detect any unauthorized traffic. Network traffic logs can be consulted to verify Suricata is policing all network traffic.

### Assurance Case 3
#### Top-Level Claim: Intrusion rules are protected against unauthorized access
![Diagram](https://github.com/UNO-CYBR-8420-Team1/CYBR8420-Suricata/blob/main/Assurance%20Cases/Assurance%20Case%20-%20Intrusion%20Rules%20are%20Protected%20Against%20Unauthorized%20Access.drawio%20(1).png)
#### Argument
For this assurance case, the top-level claim being shown pertains to the rules that are utilized by Suricata for intrusion detection and intrusion prevention. The focus of the claim is on the rules and that they are protected from unwanted individuals seeking to gain access to them.

The first concern that can arise from this claim would be doubt regarding Suricata's ability to account for changes in intrusion techniques in order to appropriately respond to new  developments that could result in vulnerabilities such as the ability to access Suricata's rulesets. In response to this first rebuttal, it can be found that Suricata possesses continual support for its intrusion rules in a variety of differing methods. The first sub-claim that addresses this initial rebuttal is that Suricata enables the utilization of specific [vendor rulesets](https://docs.suricata.io/en/latest/rule-management/suricata-update.html#using-other-rulesets). Evidence for this can be found within Suricata's documentation detailing it's usage of said rulesets that can be listed and selectively enabled within Suricata to suit particular security needs. The command for listing these rule sets is `sudo suricata-update list-sources`. A second sub-claim to further address this rebuttal includes the ability to [update Suricata](https://docs.suricata.io/en/latest/rule-management/suricata-update.html#updating-your-rules) with its supporting evidence being Suricata's script for updating its rules, `sudo suricata-update`. The third sub-claim for this rebuttal is the support for Suricata users to develop their own [custom rules](https://docs.suricata.io/en/latest/rule-management/adding-your-own-rules.html#adding-your-own-rules) to address any specific security concerns to be had for a system.

A second overarching rebuttal for this top-level claim would be the doubt of Suricata monitoring the access of its rule sets to identify those not meant to access said rules. A direct sub-claim to counter this rebuttal would be that Suricata implements system logging to combat this concern. However, this sub-claim can be further scrutinized by introducing doubt surrounding supported logging formats provided by Suricata as well as doubt regarding limitations in the information the logs are able to record. In response to the rebuttal regarding format limitations, a sub-claim is made to address this as Suricata possesses the functionality to log information in a variety of differing formats to cover activity present on a system. Evidence for Suricata's multiple logging formats is supported through their documentation where the usage of [Lua scripts](https://docs.suricata.io/en/latest/output/lua-output.html) and [EVE JSON output logs](https://docs.suricata.io/en/latest/output/eve/eve-json-format.html) are used to output a variety of differing log types denoted as events. Supported event types include HTTP, DNS, FTP, TLS, and many more. As for the concern of effectively documenting information when logging, a sub-claim to cover this rebuttal can be made as Suricata allows for a high degree of log customization through its Lua script support and configuration of EVE JSON event types.

A third rebuttal that can be presented to counter the top-level claim for this assurance case would be the concern of Suricata not possessing user identification rules to restrict access to certain aspects of the software including its intrusion rules. For this, two sub-claims could be leveraged to reassure this doubt through features such as user authentication and role-based access. There is not evidence available from Suricata currently as to support these sub-claims.

### Assurance Case 4
#### Top-Level Claim: The network logs are secure against manipulation
![Diagram](https://github.com/UNO-CYBR-8420-Team1/CYBR8420-Suricata/blob/main/Assurance%20Cases/Assurance%20Case%20-%20Logs%20secure%20against%20manipulation.drawio.png)
#### Argument
 There's concern that the network logs that are used to monitor and alert off network activity are not secure from manipulation that would hide a malicious user’s actions while accessing private information like medical records from the hospital’s private network. 

The first immediate doubt is that if someone gained access to the server they’d be able to manipulate the files stored there, including the network logs. To counter this, Suricata has configurations which include the ability to set the file’s access permissions to “600” which means in Linux (the OS of installation) that it’s user process can read and write but no other users have access to it. This presents then an undermining argument that permission configurations could be changed to allow access to those files (by mistake or on purpose). We argue that the configuration file is secure based on a series of evidences.

The second doubt  would be that if the logs are stored only on the server, they could be lost and in turn the evidence of the security breach in the logs. This could be due to purposeful loss of the Suricata server after the initial breach. To secure the logs, Suricata offers the ability to send the logs to another server for replication on a [centralized logging platform]( https://docs.suricata.io/en/latest/output/eve/eve-json-output.html#) common for robust modern infrastructure environments. One can infer based on this that logs being replicated off-device are more secure due to established data security practices. 

The third doubt would be the risk of log flooding with legit traffic that can hide malicious actions. To handle this, Suricata offers the common practice of log rotation to divide up the logs. Alone, this log rotation initially causes concern that too many logs would cause a rollover and in turn get deleted if the rotation is limited in capacity. However, log deletion is not handled by Suricata. The log capacity concern and limitations implied by rotation is a process handled outside due to the limitations of the hardware platform/capacity. This is outside the scope of the software.

### Assurance Case 5
#### Top-Level Claim: The Intrusion rules implemented in Suricata can detect the malware signature in real time
![Diagram](https://github.com/UNO-CYBR-8420-Team1/CYBR8420-Suricata/blob/main/Assurance%20Cases/Assurance%20case-%20Suricata--final.drawio.png)

The main argument is that Suricata’s IDS/IPS rules are capable of detecting Emotet malware signatures in real-time within a hospital network. Hospitals process huge amounts of sensitive patient data, and a breach caused by malware could have devastating consequences. To prevent this, Suricata must be able to quickly and accurately process traffic and identify malware signatures like Emotet as soon as they appear. Emotet is a sophisticated and evolving strain of malware primarily known for its ability to spread through malicious email attachments and links.

One important aspect is how efficiently Suricata processes traffic and triggers alerts for Emotet activity. In a hospital, where there’s always a heavy load of network traffic, delays in detection could allow malware to slip through the cracks before it's detected. To prevent this, Suricata needs to be optimized to handle large volumes of data without lagging. Suricata can process traffic efficiently due to its multi-threading capabilities Suricata Multi-Threading and distributed processing Distributed Suricata, which are designed to prevent network congestion and ensure real-time detection.

Another critical factor is the accuracy of Suricata’s detection signatures for Emotet. Since Emotet is constantly evolving, Suricata must stay updated with the latest rules to detect new variants of the malware. One major advantage is that Suricata integrates with the Emerging Threats Open (ET Open) ruleset, which provides regular updates specifically for detecting Emerging Threats Ruleset, including Emotet. This means Suricata is equipped to handle new strains of malware as soon as they emerge, though it’s important to ensure the ET Open repository itself remains up to date. Without regular updates, Suricata could miss newer malware signatures and undermine the accuracy of malware detection.

Correct configuration of Suricata is also essential to ensure accurate detection. Misconfiguring the system could lead to missed detections, especially in a hospital setting, where multiple systems and protocols are at play. Suricata’s rules need to be correctly configured to monitor the network protocols associated with Emotet, like HTTP, HTTPS. Deep packet inspection (DPI) Suricata DPI plays a key role here, as it allows Suricata to thoroughly examine traffic and detect suspicious activity. Custom rules Suricata can be implemented to further enhance the system’s ability to detect Emotet, and URI pattern matching Suricata HTTP Log can help identify behavior typical of the malware. Suricata’s SSL/TLS inspection is also critical to catch anomalies in encrypted traffic, making it harder for malware to hide.

One major challenge is that malware like Emotet may use encrypted traffic to evade detection. To counter this, Suricata’s TLS/SSL inspection feature can be used to decrypt and examine encrypted traffic, ensuring that Emotet is still detectable even in HTTPS connections Suricata SSL Decryption. The downside, though, is that inspecting encrypted traffic can slow down performance, especially in a busy environment like a hospital. Suricata addresses this by allowing administrators to carefully configure TLS/SSL rules Suricata TLS Rules, using tools like tls.store and tls.log to efficiently manage encrypted sessions while minimizing performance impacts.

## Part 2
### Alignment of evidence with Top-Level Claims (Assurances)
The alignment of the evidence identified in my diagram aligns with Suricata documentation to show an efficient network through forms of packet capture. In this case the focus is on [system load](https://docs.suricata.io/en/latest/performance/analysis.html#system-load), load balancing, and capture filters. Suricata provides the tools to be able to view an efficient network from a memory standpoint to see if traffic is not properly being allocated. The top processes are displayed after running “htop” command for a quick view as shown from documentation. Load balancing allows the system to distribute packets to the [system for better efficiency](https://docs.suricata.io/en/latest/performance/runmodes.html) . Then lastly filters for captures to choose what traffic can be [approved or denied.](https://docs.suricata.io/en/latest/performance/ignoring-traffic.html) The first 3 forms of evidence are backed up from Suricata documentation for evidence. Evidence 4 aligns with the output of the system setup of rules for alerts detection. The security analyst will be able to see in a busy production environment like the hospital if there is no log the rules are not set up or are not created. Next, Evidence 5 focuses on a report that would be external to Suricata software that would be given by management of the hospital that can forecast future expansion which would utilize a Business Needs Report. An additional external report such as a Hardware End of Life Report from the manufacturer would be utilized for the hardware the system runs that could potentially be end of life. Lastly, provided by Suricata’s website they mention the [releases](https://suricata.io/category/release/) and software versions on their website that provide important information on the system. 

The evidence presented in the second assurance case focuses heavily on logs and alerts generated by Suricata. This heavy focus was intentional to underscore the importance of Suricata being installed and configured properly to detect unauthorized network traffic. Of particular importance are the rules that are implemented and configured into Suricata. Administration practices such as [selecting which rules to enable](https://docs.suricata.io/en/latest/rule-management/index.html), [updating existing rules](https://docs.suricata.io/en/latest/rule-management/suricata-update.html#updating-your-rules), and [adding custom rules](https://docs.suricata.io/en/latest/rule-management/adding-your-own-rules.html) can enable an administrator to monitor for unauthorized network traffic. The [log/alert outputs of Suricata](https://docs.suricata.io/en/latest/output/eve/eve-json-output.html#rotate-log-file) can also be used to verify that implemented rules are functioning as intended. Proper Suricata functionality of Suricata also depends on the location (of the network) where Suricata is implemented. If Suricata is implemented on one segment of a large, multi-segment network, only the segment on which Suricata is implemented will be protected. Suricata must be implemented in the network location that offers the broadest network oversight and, therefore, the highest level of protection.

From the third assurance case, possessing the top-level claim concerning intrusion rules being protected, it was found that many sub-claims derived from rebuttals developed in response to the top-level claim were shown to have relevant pieces of evidence presently found in Suricata. Namely, instances of sub-claims pertaining to assurance for the behavior of Suricata's rules as well as Suricata's logging capabilities. With respect to Suricata's rules, relevant evidence was found in support of developed sub-claims from features provided such as [vendor rulesets](https://docs.suricata.io/en/latest/rule-management/suricata-update.html#using-other-rulesets), [rule updatability](https://docs.suricata.io/en/latest/rule-management/suricata-update.html#updating-your-rules), and [custom rule creation](https://docs.suricata.io/en/latest/rule-management/adding-your-own-rules.html#adding-your-own-rules) found for E1, E2, and E3 respectively for the security of rules. For concerns relating to logging being able to effectively highlight activity taking place on a system to the benefit of catching unwanted access to intrusion rules, support is present in the form of logging methods and outputs such as [EVE JSON output logs](https://docs.suricata.io/en/latest/output/eve/eve-json-format.html) for their configurability of multiple logging types and information logged as well as [Lua script support](https://docs.suricata.io/en/latest/output/lua-output.html) for additional visibility found for E4, E5, E6, and E7. Pieces of evidence that are not currently observed within Suricata are that of E8 and E9 for user authentication and role-based access. These observations were found previously during the process of developing use and misuse cases but once again find relevancy with respect to developing assurance in relation to this top-level claim. Providing an added functionality whether through requiring users to provide some form of authentication prior to accessing rules, or though developing specific roles for users that enables only select individuals to access intrusion rules would seek to secure this component of the software beyond what has been shown through rule management for security purposes or activity logging for those accessing rules.

We found that in several cases (as with log manipulation claim) that the security relies on the configurations themselves being properly configured and secure. With our review we found some evidence of configuration hardening through a series of capabilities/recommendations: First, is using [Landlock]( https://docs.suricata.io/en/latest/configuration/landlock.html#landlock) from the Linux Security Module as of Linux 5.13 to secure the file. Second, [configuration hardening]( https://docs.suricata.io/en/latest/configuration/suricata-yaml.html#configuration-hardening)  can be increased by setting up the “limit-noproc” flag to prevent exploits of Suricata that leveraged from it forking a new process. Third, by establishing a secure environment we can furth harden security by enabling [Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization) to prevent exploitation of the memory of the system the process is hosted on. Forth, the environment can be even further secured by being installed on a server isolated from the external internet (opposed to the private internal network of the hospital). 

We found based on assurance claim 5 that Suricata’s capability for SSL and TLS inspection creates challenges in high-traffic environments like hospitals. The inspection of encrypted traffic is crucial for detecting malware like Emotet, but this comes at the cost of performance degradation. There is a need to focus on configuring the system to balance security and performance, especially in an environment where medical systems rely heavily on encrypted data flows. Another gap is in the maintenance and application of Suricata’s IDS/IPS rules. The [Emerging Threats Open Ruleset](https://rules.emergingthreats.net/open/suricata/rules/) ruleset provides updated malware signatures, we need to ensure the rules are regularly updated to reflect the latest threat intelligence. Custom rule creation is a powerful feature in Suricata, but it requires expertise to implement effectively. In our healthcare setting, where the network is complex, creating specific rules for traffic related to medical devices and hospital systems will be critical. While Suricata provides documentation on writing custom rules, ensuring these rules are regularly tested and optimized will require ongoing effort from the IT department.

### Individual Contributions
Here's how we split the responsibilities to create initial drafts:
  - Top-Level Claim 1: Ben - Suricata protects the network from DoS attacks
  - Top-Level Claim 2: Matt - Suricata detects unauthorized network traffic
  - Top-Level Claim 3: Shane - Intrusion rules are protected against unauthorized access
  - Top-Level Claim 4: Nathan - The network logs are secure against manipulation
  - Top-Level Claim 5: Grace - The Intrusion rules implemented in Suricata can detect the malware signature in real time

  - Ben: For my contribution I focused on Top-Level Claim 1 / Assurance Case #1, “Suricata protects the network from  DoS attacks.“ There were a few iterations of assurance cases that I had come out with but I found myself being too generic or too broad that would lead the technical expert astray. The group was able to chime in and also provide feedback on iterations. In addition to that my focus seemed to be externally vs internally which we had learned from the professor that this ultimately needs to be focused inward. After going through a few iterations I was able to hone more on the internal security side and leave out compound statements to provide more clarity on the assurance case. The plan going forward was to make sure that these were more concise for example my first iteration was so broad on the wording that it wasn't easy for the reader to follow in addition to thinking I needed to add each bit that professor did for his assurance case which resulted in a forced approach which wasn’t correct. Additionally I focused better on the wording aspect to prevent myself from running into doubts by the end user as pointed out by group members. Other contributions include team feedback on assurance cases, git hub assurance development cases, some GitHub file additions, following up with group member to recap missed meeting due to work obligation due to time frame, and team reflection.
  - Matt: For my contributions on the Assurance Case assignment, I completed Assurance Case #2 - Suricata detects unauthorized network traffic. This included the assurance case diagram, the argument, and the narrative defining the alignment with the top level claim. I utilized GitHub Project Board to highlight the assurance case I worked on and marked it complete when I completed my assurance case. I attended our check-in with Dr. Gandhi and both weekly team meetings on Friday. I helped brainstorm other assurance cases and received helpful clarification from other team members regarding assurance cases and what was needed. I provided feedback to others and relied on their feedback as well to tweak my submissions to ensure the work I produced matched Dr. Gandhi’s (and the team’s) expectations. This assignment was a challenge for me. Even with reviewing the materials multiple times, I was not sure of what I needed to produce. Even with a top-level claim, coming up with subclaims and rebuttals proved to be a difficult task. Interacting with other team members helped my understanding and refining of my claims and rebuttals, and I feel I have a much better understanding of assurance cases than I did previously.
  - Shane: For my contributions on this deliverable, I have focused on the completion of assurance case #3 with its corresponding diagram and written component as well as evidence alignment contributions derived from my assurance case. I have attended all group meetings and have worked to provide feedback on other people's assurance case diagrams as well as proofreading and polishing various sections of the deliverable. During our weekly group meeting I contributed by providing feedback for refining and finalizing top-level claims following our meeting with the professor. Aside from working on deliverable components, I had volunteered to take notes during our professor meeting for later referencing when working through the deliverable in greater detail. I have also started trying to work with using the issue functionality on our group's GitHub project board on my assigned assurance case task. I have intended to try it while working on this deliverable as a pilot experience to learn about how to use the feature as I have little experience with it previously. My hope is that I can take what I have learned about using issues and how to communicate in issue threads within our project board and put them to effective use with the rest of the group going forward. A struggle I had when learning about this functionality was learning how to close issues using commits, but after reading some documentation on using proper keywords I now have a better understanding of this action.
  - Nathan: I created the initial template for the deliverables document and the initial project tasks in GitHub. I then created a list of roughly 8 initial top-level claim ideas to work off of. I also created an initial top-level claim diagram for the professor meeting to review together and keep us moving forward with feedback. I then tried to provide feedback on Ben's initial top-level claim being a little too general before that meeting to provide insight. I then helped lead the discussion in Ben's absence for our weekly internal team meeting. The meeting was productive and kept things moving forward with help from the team. I then contributed to the teams assurances cases while providing feedback there as well. Lastly, I added contributions to the reflection of the team, noting the issue with proper configuration being a common trend on our open source software.

  - Grace: For this assignment, I took care on Assurance Case #5, focusing on conducting thorough research and building the diagrams. I made sure to dive deep into understanding the technical aspects of Suricata and its application to malware detection, particularly Emotet. This required reviewing various sources and aligning them with the assurance case methodology taught. This was proven to be the hardest and time-consuming task during this assignment to make sure the diagram is clear and technically sound. I actively participated in all team meetings discussing the feedback we received on each other diagrams. When feedback was given, I refined my arguments. Asking questions when I was unclear helped improve my understanding of the process. This ensured that my work was accurate, meaningful, and aligned with the assignment.

### Team Reflection
This milestone we were able to work together to brainstorm ideas for different assurance cases. We were able to get the run down for what is expected for this milestone, especially after further explanation from the professor. There were a few spots we had to focus on for our top-level claim assurance cases such as removing “and/or” compound statements to prevent lengthy cases and provide better clarity. In addition to this, thinking more internally vs. externally was a spot that needed to be cleared up as well when developing our assurance cases. Also, an area where there was a little confusion was that not necessarily all assurance cases will use every component provided in the example diagram from the professor. We did not want to force anything that did not necessarily need to be there on the assurance case. We also want to strengthen our utilization of commits directly with comments and discussion, we as a group instead when making commits to our repo are putting the comments there instead of directly closing commits with our project board.

We noted while trying to work through our assurances that the security was often based on the assumption of proper configuration and that the configuration wouldn't be manipulated. So the configuration hardening was an important aspect of our review, however it also bled into the outside scope of the software security aspect. That being ensuring the operational environment is secure. 
	
This time around the usual Friday meeting at 12 proved to be difficult since we had previously arranged a time that might mostly work for the team. We found that our team lead was unfortunately unable to make it due to a work call that bled through our review. The good news is we were able to work through this as a group and had Nathan help facilitate the meeting along with the help of Grace and Shane to help take care of and address concerns of this milestone. The take away from this unforeseen circumstance was working through a spontaneous hiccup and still being able to move things along while creating a work around. Following the meeting, Shane worked with Ben to provide an update of what happened to get him back on track and the whole group up to speed.
