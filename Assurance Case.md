### Team Reflection
This milestone we were able to work together to brainstorm ideas for different assurance cases. We were able to get the run down for what is expected for this milestone, especially after further explanation from the professor. There were a few spots we had to focus on for our top-level claim assurance cases such as removing “and/or” compound statements to prevent lengthy cases and provide better clarity. In addition to this, thinking more internally vs externally was a spot that needed to be cleared up as well when developing our assurance cases. Also an area where there was a little confusion was that not necessarily all assurance cases will use every component to their diagram that was given as a diagram, we don’t want to force anything that doesn’t necessarily need to be there on the assurance case.
