This assurance case focuses on Suricata protecting the network from DoS or Denial of Service attacks. The idea that a denial of service attack can affect the way the system runs can impact the network systems, services, and accountability of care given to the customers of the hospital.

The system is set up for efficient packet capture through system load, load balancing and capture filters. Some evidence we have to reinforce whether the system is set up to work efficiently or needs additional adjustment is [performance analysis](https://docs.suricata.io/en/latest/performance/analysis.html) in which we can see the system load to get an idea of the traffic breakdown. The user can run the “htop” command to see the results. Additionally within the performance analysis we can check stats.log or suricata.log files for a deeper dive into this analysis. Next, the user will need to run load balancing to run multithreading to offset load of network traffic to the system which allows it to take on more data and analyze through it more efficiently. The breakup of the network traffic allows it to properly sort this traffic to prevent overload and system degradation/failure. The security analyst can also set up [capture filters](https://docs.suricata.io/en/latest/performance/ignoring-traffic.html) to allow the system to ignore specific traffic to allow the focus on what the analyst actually wants to see, preventing alert and log fatigue allowing only the important data to stream through and be logged.

Next part of the rebuttal of Suricata software is not set up properly is that Suricata rules are created to mitigate traffic. The customer and security analyst are able to tell if rules are set up properly or created based off the result from the alerts detection log. If the system doesn’t log anything we can draw an inference that there are no rules created or they were not properly set up since the system will never be perfect for there is always traffic running in the hospital environment that is very busy. Rules can be specified by the security analyst in set up and are found with more data in section [11.11.5 Rules](https://docs.suricata.io/en/latest/performance/analysis.html#rules).

Although not specifically stated in the Suricata documentation hardware limitations exist in any system and can affect the way a system performs. Suricata mentions that with certain hardware [requirements](https://docs.suricata.io/en/latest/capture-hardware/ebpf-xdp.html#requirements) such as a system that can run kernel XDP and a network card that supports XDP. The expansion of business or end of life (EOL) hardware can cause future troubles or limitations to the efficiency of the system and how it performs. If the system only has 10GB of memory, logs could fill leading to system failure before the logs could be stored and reviewed in a larger hospital network. The claim for business growing exponentially is that Suricata is retrofitted with future expansion to prevent this from happening which can be provided by a business needs report from hospital tech management. The claim that hardware is end of life is that obsolete hardware is replaced proactively. The evidence from this is a manufacturer’s end of life report that allows the business to know what needs replaced before it is no longer supported to stay on top.

Last rebuttal part of this assurance case for Suricata protecting the network from DoS is that Suricata is not up to date. A system that is not up to date especially handling the needs of Personally Identifiable Information or (PII) can be exposed to malicious actors. The security analyst will regularly stay up to date with Suricata [releases](https://suricata.io/category/release/) which are managed and verified from Suricata’s direct website.

### Top-Level Claim 3
![Diagram](https://github.com/UNO-CYBR-8420-Team1/CYBR8420-Suricata/blob/main/Assurance%20Cases/Assurance%20Case%20-%20Intrusion%20Rules%20are%20Protected%20Against%20Unauthorized%20Access.drawio%20(1).png)
#### Argument
For this assurance case, the top-level claim being shown pertains to the rules that are utilized by Suricata for intrusion detection and intrusion prevention. The focus of the claim is on the rules and that they are protected from unwanted individuals seeking to gain access to them.

The first concern that can arise from this claim would be doubt regarding Suricata's ability to account for changes in intrusion techniques in order to appropriately respond to new  developments that could result in vulnerabilities such as the ability to access Suricata's rulesets. In response to this first rebuttal, it can be found that Suricata possesses continual support for its intrusion rules in a variety of differing methods. The first sub-claim that addresses this initial rebuttal is that Suricata enables the utilization of specific [vendor rulesets](https://docs.suricata.io/en/latest/rule-management/suricata-update.html#using-other-rulesets). Evidence for this can be found within Suricata's documentation detailing it's usage of said rulesets that can be listed and selectively enabled within Suricata to suit particular security needs. The command for listing these rule sets is `sudo suricata-update list-sources`. A second sub-claim to further address this rebuttal includes the ability to [update Suricata](https://docs.suricata.io/en/latest/rule-management/suricata-update.html#updating-your-rules) with its supporting evidence being Suricata's script for updating its rules, `sudo suricata-update`. The third sub-claim for this rebuttal is the support for Suricata users to develop their own [custom rules](https://docs.suricata.io/en/latest/rule-management/adding-your-own-rules.html#adding-your-own-rules) to address any specific security concerns to be had for a system.

A second overarching rebuttal for this top-level claim would be the doubt of Suricata monitoring the access of its rule sets to identify those not meant to access said rules. A direct sub-claim to counter this rebuttal would be that Suricata implements system logging to combat this concern. However, this sub-claim can be further scrutinized by introducing doubt surrounding supported logging formats provided by Suricata as well as doubt regarding limitations in the information the logs are able to record. In response to the rebuttal regarding format limitations, a sub-claim is made to address this as Suricata possesses the functionality to log information in a variety of differing formats to cover activity present on a system. Evidence for Suricata's multiple logging formats is supported through their documentation where the usage of [Lua scripts](https://docs.suricata.io/en/latest/output/lua-output.html) and [EVE JSON output logs](https://docs.suricata.io/en/latest/output/eve/eve-json-format.html) are used to output a variety of differing log types denoted as events. Supported event types include HTTP, DNS, FTP, TLS, and many more. As for the concern of effectively documenting of information when logging, a sub-claim to cover this rebuttal can be made as Suricata allows for high degree of log customization through its Lua script support and configuration of EVE JSON event types.

A third rebuttal that can be presented to counter the top-level claim for this assurance case would be the concern of Suricata not possessing user identification rules to restrict access to certain aspects of Suricata including its intrusion rules. For this, two sub-claims could be leveraged to reassure this doubt through features such as user authentication and role-based access. There is not evidence available from Suricata currently as to support these sub-claims.

### Top-Level Claim 4
![Diagram](https://github.com/UNO-CYBR-8420-Team1/CYBR8420-Suricata/blob/main/Assurance%20Cases/Assurance%20Case%20-%20Logs%20secure%20against%20manipulation.drawio.png)
#### Argument
 There's concern that the network logs that are used to monitor and alert off network activity are not secure from manipulation that would hide a malicious user’s actions while accessing private information like medical records from the hospital’s private network. 

The first immediate doubt is that if someone gained access to the server they’d be able to manipulate the files stored there, including the network logs. To counter this, Suricata has configurations which include the ability to set the file’s access permissions to “600” which means in Linux (the OS of installation) that it’s user process can read and write but no other users have access to it. This presents then an undermining argument that permission configurations could be changed to allow access to those files (by mistake or on purpose). We argue that the configuration file is secure based on a series of evidences.

The second doubt  would be that if the logs are stored only the server, they could be lost (and in turn the evidence of the security breach in the logs. This could be due to purposeful lose of the Suricata server after the initial breach. To secure the logs, Suricata offers the ability to send the logs to another server for replication on a [centralized logging platform]( https://docs.suricata.io/en/latest/output/eve/eve-json-output.html#) common for robust modern infrastructure environments. One can infer based on this that logs being replicated off-device are more secure due to established data security practices. 

The third doubt would be the risk if log flooding with legit traffic can hide malicious actions. To handle this, Suricata offers the common practice of log rotation to divide up the logs. Alone, this log rotation itself initially causes concern that too many logs would cause the rollover and in turn get deleted if the rotation is limited in capacity. However, log deletion is not handled by Suricata. The log capacity concern and limitations implied by rotation is a process handled outside due to the limitations of the hardware platform/capacity. This is outside the scope of the software.

## Part 2
### Alignment of evidence with Top-Level Claims (Assurances)
We found that in several cases (as with log manipulation claim) that the security relies on the configurations themselves being properly configured and secure. With our review we found some evidence of configuration hardening through a series of capabilities/recommendations: First, is using [Landlock]( https://docs.suricata.io/en/latest/configuration/landlock.html#landlock) from the Linux Security Module as of Linux 5.13 to secure the file. Second, [configuration hardening]( https://docs.suricata.io/en/latest/configuration/suricata-yaml.html#configuration-hardening)  can be increased by setting up the “limit-noproc” flag to prevent exploits of Suricata that leveraged from it forking a new process. Third, by establishing a secure environment we can furth harden security by enabling [Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization) to prevent exploitation of the memory of the system the process is hosted on. Forth, the environment can be even further secured by being installed on a server isolated from the external internet (opposed to the private internal network of the hospital).

### Individual Contributions
Here's how we split the responsibilities to create initial drafts:
  - Top-Level Claim 1: Ben - Suricata protects the network from DOS attacks
  - Top-Level Claim 2: Matt
  - Top-Level Claim 3: Shane - Intrusion Rules are Protected Against Unauthorized Access
  - Top-Level Claim 4: Nathan - The network logs are secure against manipulation
  - Top-Level Claim 5: Grace

DELETE THIS -> LEFT TO REMINDER [Include a reflection on your teamwork for this assignment. What issues occurred? How did you resolve them? What did you plan to change moving forward?]

  - Ben: For my contribution I focused on Top-Level Claim 1 / Assurance 1, “Suricata protects the network from  DoS attacks.“ There were a few iterations of assurance cases that I had come out with but I found myself being too generic or too broad that would lead the technical expert astray. The group was able to chime in and also provide feedback on iterations. In addition to that my focus seemed to be externally vs internally which we had learned from the professor that this ultimately needs to be focused inward. After going through a few iterations I was able to hone more on the internal security side and leave out compound statements to provide more clarity on the assurance case. The plan going forward was to make sure that these were more concise for example my first iteration was so broad on the wording that it wasn't easy for the reader to follow in addition to thinking I needed to add each bit that professor did for his assurance case which resulted in a forced approach which wasn’t correct. Additionally I focused better on the wording aspect to prevent myself from running into doubts by the end user as pointed out by group members. Other contributions include team feedback on assurance cases, git hub assurance development cases, some GitHub file additions, following up with group member to recap missed meeting due to work obligation due to time frame, and team reflection.
  - Matt:
  - Shane:
  - Nathan: Created the initial template for the deliverable document and the initial project tasks in GitHub project tasks. Then created a list of ~8 initial top-level claim ideas to work off of. Also created an initial top-level claim diagram for professor meeting to review together and keep us moving forward with feedback. Nathan tried to provide feedback on Ben's initial top-level claim being too general before that meeting too. Nathan then helped lead the discussion in Ben's absence for our weekly internal team meeting despite not sharing his screen (just the browser) and wasted some time confusing the team. Regardless, the meeting was productive and Nathan kept things moving forward with help from the team of course. Nathan then provided feedback on Ben's argument regarding the evidence being "soft" and not facts as noted. Nathan added contributions to the reflection of the team as well, noting the issue with "proper configuration" being a common trend on our open source software.

  - Grace: For this assignment, I took the care on Assurance Case #5, focusing on conducting thorough research and building the diagrams. I made sure to dive deep into understanding the technical aspects of Suricata and its application to malware detection, particularly Emotet. This required reviewing various sources and aligning them with the assurance case methodology taught. I put effort into making the diagrams clear and technically sound. I actively participated in all team meeting discussing the feedback we received on each other diagrams. When feedback was given, I refined my arguments. Asking questions when I was unclear helped improve my understanding of the process. This ensured that my work was accurate, meaningful, and aligned with the assignment.

### Team Reflection
This milestone we were able to work together to brainstorm ideas for different assurance cases. We were able to get the run down for what is expected for this milestone, especially after further explanation from the professor. There were a few spots we had to focus on for our top-level claim assurance cases such as removing “and/or” compound statements to prevent lengthy cases and provide better clarity. In addition to this, thinking more internally vs externally was a spot that needed to be cleared up as well when developing our assurance cases. Also an area where there was a little confusion was that not necessarily all assurance cases will use every component to their diagram that was given as a diagram, we don’t want to force anything that doesn’t necessarily need to be there on the assurance case.

We noted while trying to work through our assurances that the security was often based on the assumption of "proper" configuration and that the configuration wouldn't be manipulated. So the "configuration hardening" was an important aspect of our review, however it also bled into the outside the scope of the software itself security aspect. That being ensuring the operational environment is secure. 
	
 We also ran into this operational environment security in other aspects and at what level of detail should we include it. With log manipulation, deletion of logs is handled outside Suricata. Which simplifies the security concern of Suricata itself, as it won't auto-delete if rolling over too fast. However, if not enough space is allocated and alerts on the hardware that it runs on then that will impact Suricata and it's ability to enforce it's assurances. Of course, with denial of services attacks we also ran into this as well since the ability to scale software wise is only one aspect but if the hardware can't keep up that is not the limitation of the Suricata application.
