## Part 2 - Review of Suricata Project Documentation for Security-Related Configuration and Installation Issues

To review Suricata's security-related documentation, we looked at the project's official documentation for installation and configuration, particularly focusing on sections related to security. Here's a summary of our observations, along with suggestions for improvement:

## 1. Security in Installation and Setup
Suricataâ€™s installation documentation provides detailed instructions on how to install the software on different platforms, but security-related best practices during installation, such as setting up secure user permissions or guidelines for minimizing security risks, are not as prominently featured. For example, running Suricata as a non-root user is crucial for limiting potential damage from an exploit. However, this recommendation is not emphasized. It would be helpful if this section included more specific security tips for installation, such as setting the right access controls and preventing privilege escalation.
